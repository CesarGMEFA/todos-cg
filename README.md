## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](tailwindcss.com)
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot, internalized many ReactJS concepts and learned dependency like drop and drag to be able to move objects in the DOM.

### Continued development

I'll be focusing on more practices with ReactJS and NextJS.

I received support and guidance in a study group on the Platzi platform and also feedback from friends who showed them the app and a comment on frontendmentor that helped me, so I was able to make changes that I had not seen.
